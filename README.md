# Note Taking Appliction

## Description
This is a simple note taking application designed to take a user input note and render it into a notes list. The list allows deleteing a note.

The purpose of this project was to practice connecting the front and back ends of an applicaiton. I learned how to write routes in express js and how to test them in Insomnia. I also deployed the app on render.
